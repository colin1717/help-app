## Overview and Motivation

The CrowdCare Application was created in order to foster volunteer efforts in close-knit social circles. We designed the app as a "volunteer virtual pot luck", wherein the creator of a Vounteer Project can create tasks that are needed for the specific project. These tasks are placed in three states, once created, assigned, completed and signed-off. These "states" create a checks and balances system between the volunteer and the project owner, in regards to tasks. 


## Our Approach

We approached creating this app with the MVP in mind. We utilized a MOSCOW strategy for develpment.

    Mo - Must Have: What does this app absolutely HAVE TO HAVE in order to function properly?
         This is also known as the MVP.
    S -  Should Have: This functionality is what the app should have, based on what a user
         expects to see in a pet adoption app. This is based on the products that have already 
         paved the way in the market space. Users have seen certain features on similar apps,
         so this is their "norm".
    Co - Could Have: These are the "bells and whistles" features that could be added to increase 
         the WOW factor of our app. These will only be implemented after the Must Haves and Should Haves 
         are fleshed out, and solidly working.
    W -  Won't Have: Generally, these are the ideas akin to "Let's create an app that's a mash up
         of Facebook and.. all of Google... and let's do it in a couple of days!" In other words, 
         these are features that are placed in the Ice Box.

## Technologies

* Ruby - Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and 
          developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

* Ruby on Rails - Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT 
                  License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database,
                  a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or 
                  XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to 
                  MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, 
                  including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.

* RubyGems - RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format 
              for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed 
              to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. RubyGems was created 
              around November 2003 and is now part of the standard library from Ruby version 1.9.

* PostgreSQL - PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres or alternatively pgSQL, is an object-relational database management 
               system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.

* Active Record - The Ruby library ActiveRecord implements ORM. It creates a persistable domain model from business 
                  objects and database tables, where logic and data are presented as a unified package. 

* JavaScript - JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.

* jQuery -  jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like 
            HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

* $.ajax -  AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of 
            the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files.
     

* ERB -     ERB is a client-side templating system that embeds Ruby into an HTML document.

* HTML -    HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages). HTML stands 
            for Hyper Text Markup Language. A markup language is a set of markup tags. HTML documents are described by HTML tags. Each HTML tag describes different document content.

* CSS -     Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing 
            the presentation of a document written in a markup language.

* SASS -    Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) is a CSS precompiler. 
            

* Devise -  Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails.


* Heroku -  Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to             go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

* Git and GitHub - As Git is a distributed version control system, it can be used as a server out of the box. Dedicated 
                  Git server software helps, amongst other features, to add access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, and help managing multiple repositories.

* Lucidchart - Lucidchart is the online diagramming application that we utilized when creating our User Flows and our
               Wire Frames.
